Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Note:
Assume with are only dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer
range: [-2^31, 2^31-1]. For the purpoose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reverse
integer overflows.

example 1: 
    Input: x = 123
    Ouput: 321

example 2:
    Input: x = -123
    Output: -321

example 3:
    Input: x = 120
    Output: 21

example 4:
    Input: x = 0
    Output: 0
